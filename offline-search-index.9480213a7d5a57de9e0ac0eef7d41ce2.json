Make sure to download OpenPnP 2.0 for your machine. OpenPNP 2.0\n  From here, you could set up your machine from scratch using the OpenPnP Wiki, but we’ve done a lot of the hard work for you and made a configuration file that has all of the transferrable configuration already set to go. Among the assets included in your Build Number’s Release, download Source Code (zip), unzip it, and then open the openpnp folder to find the premade configuration files.\n  Now it’s time to import the default configuration for your LumenPnP. OpenPnP saves configuration files in different places depending on your operating system. This folder has a period in front of its name, meaning it’s hidden! The folder is still there, it just won’t show up in your file explorer. You might need to do something with your settings to get it to show up. If you’re on Windows, click here for instructions, and here if you’re on Mac.\n  The information below about how to find the config files directory on your computer is pulled from the OpenPnP Wiki.\n Configuration files are located in your home directory, under a subdirectory called .openpnp2.\nOn Mac this will typically be /Users/[username]/.openpnp2.\nOn Windows 2000, XP and 2003 it will be C:\\Documents and Settings[username].openpnp2.\nOn Windows Vista and above it’s C:\\Users[username].openpnp2.\nConfiguration files are in XML format and can be edited by hand in a text editor. You should shutdown OpenPnP before editing files by hand as OpenPnP will rewrite the configuration files on exit.\nThere are three primary configuration files. They are:\nmachine.xml: Contains the primary configuration for the entire system, including information about the machine, cameras, feeders, nozzles, etc.\nparts.xml: A portable parts database. As you define parts (components) in OpenPnP they are stored here.\npackages.xml: A portable packages database. Component package information including shape and dimensions are stored here.\n Once you’ve found your .openpnp2 folder, drop the machine.xml, parts.xml, and packages.xml files into it. If you already have parts and packages configured from previous usage of OpenPnP, you can just drop in the machine.xml file.\n","categories":"","description":"Install OpenPNP and import default config\n","excerpt":"Install OpenPNP and import default config\n","ref":"/openpnp/calibration/import-config/","tags":"","title":"Importing Config Files"},{"body":"There are five types of connectors that need to be soldered into your motherboard. We’ll go over each one, and how to solder them in place.\n     Screw Terminal In your connector bag you’ll find a screw terminal connector. This provides power to the machine, and goes into the J12 footprint on the upper-right corner of the board. Ensure that the openings that accept the power cables are facing outwards.\n  IDC Connectors The IDC connectors are the larger, black connectors in your connector bag. There are only two sizes, a 2x3 for feeder communication, and three 2x6 for the auxillary ports. Be sure to solder them the correct orientation. The slot on the connector should match up with the silkscreen.\n     JST XH Connectors The bulk of the connectors on the board are JST XH connectors. These come in two, three, and four pin variations. The two pin connectors are for the mosfets, the three pin connectors are for the servos, limit switches, and ring lights, and the four pin connectors are for the stepper motors.\nWARNING The 4-pin JST XH connector for the Y2 motor (the one right next to the Y silkscreen indicator) needs to be rotated 180 degrees from what the silkscreen dictates. This one should be soldered in reverse, opposite of the silkscreen indication. Refer to the image below for reference.           USB A Connectors There are three USB A connectors that need to be soldered into the board as well. Two of these are for the webcams, and the third is for future functionality. We recommend soldering the large structural tabs in place first, then soldering the four data pins afterward.\n  Stepper Motor Driver Headers The last connectors that need to be soldered into the board are the 1x8 Dupont 0.1\" headers for the stepper motor drivers. Two connectors need to be soldered for each driver. We recommend soldering a single pin in place first while getting the connector to stay flat, then do the rest of the pins after the orientation is solidified. Orientation does not matter for these connectors.\n  ","categories":"","description":"Instructions about how to install the THT components into a LumenPnP Motherboard","excerpt":"Instructions about how to install the THT components into a LumenPnP …","ref":"/docs/motherboard/installing-tht/","tags":"","title":"Install THT Components"},{"body":"The left and right Y motors are connected to the motherboard using the cable harnesses CHA-0001 and CHA-0002, respectively.

Use four zip ties to secure the wires in place using the channels in the back legs as shown below.\n           Next, put your LumenPnP up on its haunches, and route the cables along the inside groove of the extrusion running towards the front of the machine. Use the cable clips to hold the cables in place.\n     Once the cables have been routed to the underside of the staging plate, use a cable clamp, M3x14mm bolt, and M3 nut to hold the cables as shown in the image below.\n       Route the cables underneath the motherboard for now; we’ll plug them in in a later step!\n","categories":"","description":"Routing and connecting the Y motor cables \n","excerpt":"Routing and connecting the Y motor cables \n","ref":"/docs/wiring-and-pneumatics/wiring-y-motors/","tags":"","title":"Wiring the Y Motors"},{"body":"Congratulations! Your machine is now calibrated, configured, and ready to have a job loaded up!\nOpenPnP documentation will take you from here, but these topics are the ones we recommend you read and pursue first:\n  Further Calibration\n Your machine is calibrated and you should have good results placing parts after completing the prior steps. However, there’s an “Issues and Solutions” tab in OpenPnP that will help you further calibrate your LumenPnP, for help with those steps we recommend reviewing the OpenPnP docs. It’s highly recommended that you complete the “Calibrations Milestone” prior to using your LumenPnP in production.    Job Setup\n This is an incredibly useful document, illustrating the difference between parts, packages, and placements, and how to import information about your parts into the software. It shows the UI and explains what lots of things do, along with walking you through setting up a job. There’s also information about setting up feeders. We use mainly ReferenceTrayFeeder and ReferenceStripFeeder, and find they work well for us! Soon we’ll have our own powered feeder for the LumenPnP, which will have a selectable feeder type in OpenPnP, but that’s still to come.    Vacuum Sensing\n Your machine is capable of detecting a mispick using its onboard vacuum sensors. This can help speed up the process of trying to pick another part, instead of waiting for vision to detect it. Be sure to reference the actuator test Gcode in the assembly docs for the snippets needed to request the vacuum value from the motherboard.

Read the information about picking your Build Number on the “LumenPnP Assembly” page to find out what version of parts to print. You can find the parts you need on the Releases Page, and look at the attached Assets at the bottom of the release. Click and download 3d-prints.zip to get the STL files for your machine. If you are building your kit, make sure you know your Hardware Version before printing parts.\nCalibration Print Before printing the parts, print the calibration print. This is FDM-8000, colloquially refered to as “the corndog.” To ensure you have your printer dialed into the tolerances we expect in our designs, this part has every feature in the printable parts with a tolerance requirement. After printing, you can check fit of fasteners and aluminum extrusion to ensure the parts you print will all fit as expected.\n  You can test the Corndog’s fit using M3 and M5 bolts, along with M3 and M5 nuts. Check to see that the press-fit nut hexagonal voids and drop-in vertical nut slots fit M3 and M5 nuts correctly, that M3 and M5 bolts can easily pass through and countersink through their holes. The two holes inside the lock icon should be a good tap-thread fit. You should be able to thread M3 and M5 bolts into those holes with a bit of effort, but it should grip well into the print. You can also check the fit of a 20mm x 20mm aluminum extrusion fit into the square hole on the end of the print.\nPrinting The Parts How Many Of Each? You can find out how many of each part to print in index_bom.md, which is also an Asset of the release with your Build Number. You can view this file using an online Markdown viewer like this one. Select “Import From” -\u003e “Markdown File” and select index_bom.md. The Filename column will tell you which part to print, and the Quantity column will tell you how many to print. Only pay attention to Filenames that start with “FDM-”, as these are the ones in the zip file you downloaded earlier. The other items in this table are a list of all the other fasteners, hardware, and off the shelf parts used in the machine’s mechanical build. All of these have been provided in the kit.\n  What Material? Development with the machine is done with PLA, but folks have had great success printing these parts in PETG as well.\nFor colors, there is only one specific requirement: two parts must be printed in white/natural material: FDM-0015 Down Light Mount and FDM-0019 Up Light Mount. These parts have a thin section where the print acts as a diffuser for the ring lights. A dark color would prevent light from shining through.\nWe recommend printing the Z gantries (FDM-0017 and FDM-0039) in a dark color. This helps isolate the illuminated part on the nozzle tip, and reflects less light. If you choose to print them in a light color anyway, we’ve found a bit of blue painter’s tape applied to the bottom side of the parts works just fine.\nWhat Settings To Use? Of course, every printer is different, but the settings below are a rough outline of where you should be in terms of part strength. It’s also important to note that these parts are designed for printers with a 0.4mm nozzle. Using a larger nozzle diameter can result in some features not resolving correctly, or parts not fitting as designed.\nDefault Settings  3 shells 20% infill 5 Top/Bottom layers 0.2mm layer height Use Support  Gantry Settings  4 shells 30% infill 5 Top/Bottom layers 0.2mm layer height Use Support  Gantry Settings should be used for:  FDM-0005 (Y-gantry) FDM-0008 (Y-gantry Support) FDM-0009 (Roller-Spacer) FDM-0011 (X-gantry Front) FDM-0012 (X-gantry Back) FDM-0013 (X-Idler Mount) FDM-0017 (Z-gantry Left)  9000 Series Parts? There are some parts in the project that have a part number in the 9000s. These prints are totally optional, and not necessary to print.\n","categories":"","description":"Printing all the parts necessary for the build\n","excerpt":"Printing all the parts necessary for the build\n","ref":"/docs/mechanical-assembly/printing-parts/","tags":"","title":"Printing Parts"},{"body":"Awesome! Now we’ve got OpenPnP installed on your computer, and we’ve got the default Index configuration loaded up, our next step is calibrating the fisheye out of the camera lenses. Almost all of the settings in this menu are preset for the machine, but there are a few that you’ll need to do for your specific machine. Lens Fisheye Calibration is one of these. Also, you can reference the orignal OpenPnP documentation about this step here.\n Click on the Machine Setup tab along the top of the UI    What you see is a tree of all the components of a Pick and Place machine. We recommend expanding this menu using the Expand check box to see the full depths of the objects.    Now, look under the Cameras menu (not the one under Reference Head H1, but instead the one with no parent elements), and click on OpenPnpCaptureCamera Bottom or similar. You should see a menu appear underneath. This is how settings are edited in OpenPnP: an element is clicked in this tree view, and you can change its settings in the menu below.     Next, we need to make sure OpenPnP can see the cameras. Click on the Device Settings tab in the camera settings menu, and for the “Device” dropdown select “PnP Bottom Camera”. Make sure the format is set to 1280x720, 10FPS.\n  In the camera settings menu, click the Lens Calibration tab, then click “Start Lens Calibration”.\n  OpenPnP is now looking for a very specific pattern of dots which it uses to figure out how fisheyed the view is, and correct it. Hold your datum board over the bottom camera and using the viewfinder, move the calibration pattern around the camera’s field of view until OpenPnP tells you that it’s gathered enough photos. Make sure it’s in focus of the camera, otherwise it’ll have a hard time finding the pattern. If the focal distance is too close such that you can’t get the whole pattern in focus and in the field of view, screw in the lens a few turns and test again.\n  If you’re having a hard time getting the camera to pick up on the pattern on the datum board, you can always print out the original calibration pattern recommended by OpenPnP, which you can find here. Be sure to download the “Circle Grid Camera Calibration Patterns” image.\nTip To see both camera views at the same time, click on the dropdown in the top left of the UI and select “Show All Horizontal”.  Now, we’ll do the top camera. Go through the same process of configuring the camera in OpenPnP, but instead of finding the top camera in the “Camera” menu, you’ll find it under Heads -\u003e Reference Head H1 -\u003e Cameras.

Next, manually move the Y gantry all the way to the front of the machine, and the X gantry all the way to the left. Then, power up your machine by plugging in the provided power brick.\nHeads Up The motherboard will not show up on your computer if not powered up through the screw terminal port. USB power is not used to prevent overdrawing current from your computer’s USB port. Make sure you’re powering the board from the screw terminal and not just connecting over USB.  Now, it’s time to check and see if your computer recognizes the motherboard. We’re going to use CNCjs to check this, but feel free to use any other tool you’d like. Download a CNCjs release and install.\nOpen CNCjs and in the Connection wigit, select the Marlin tab. Click the refresh button next to the Port dropdown, and click the dropdown to see if your computer found the board. If you’re on Windows, the port should look like COM1 or something similar, Mac should look like /dev/tty.usbserial00000, and Linux should look like /dev/tty.ACM0.\nKeep the Baud Rate at 115200, and click the Open button. If you see boot text enter the Console wigit, you’ve successfully connected to your LumenPnP!\nCameras We also need to check connecting to the cameras. CNCjs has a webcam feature, so we’ll use it for this test too. Find the Webcam tab in the bottom left of the window, click on the module using the little slider icon, open the widget using the carrot icon, and finally click the gear and look for detected webcams in the dropdown under “Use a built-in camera or a connected webcam”. You should find “PnP Top Camera” and “PnP Bottom Camera” in the dropdown. Select each one and test out the camera feed.\n  Important Some combinations of the USB hub chip we use in the motherboard and USB hub chips used in computers don’t allow for video streaming to work for one or both cameras. If you don’t see either or both cameras appear, don’t worry! You can always unplug them from the motherboard and plug them directly into your computer.

First, we’re going to build up the left side of the machine.\nBelt Tension Arm    Insert an M3 Hex Nut into the back of a Belt Tension Arm (FDM-0037).    Insert the M3x16mm Machine Screw through the front hole in the Belt Tension Arm and then tighten. Thread an M3 Cap Nut on the end of the M3x16mm Machine Screw.    Insert the M5x25mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top of the Belt Tension Arm so that it passes through a GT2 Pulley Idler. Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the Belt Tension Arm and tighten. Make sure the idler can still spin freely.    Insert the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the Front Left Leg (FDM-0001). Insert completed Belt Tension Arm assembly between the arms on the front leg, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up. Insert the M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the Belt Tension Arm and tighten into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut. Do not overtighten, and ensure you can still pivot the tension arm.    Assembly Take the Back Left Leg (FDM-0003) and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the holes in which they’re inserted. If you have a hard time getting the extrusion into the slots, gently slide them into place using some taps from a mallet.    Take the front left leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the back leg. Your progress should look like the image below.    On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.    On the bottom rail, the outer side (shown above) has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.    On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the back leg. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.    Next, attach the GT2 Timing Pulley to the spindle of a NEMA17 stepper motor. Tighten one of the grub screws on the pulley into the flat spot on the spindle. Then mount the NEMA17 stepper motor to the back left leg. Attach it using four M3x8mm screws, ensuring that the connector is facing inwards towards the zip tie loops as dictated in the picture.    Mount one of the three limit switches to the front left leg as shown in the image. Use two M3x8mm screws and tap them directly into the print.    Next, we’ll mount the Frame Umbilical Mount (FDM-0007). Using two M5x25mm screws, attach it to the front left leg as shown, threading directly into the part.    Lastly, we’ll assemble the umbilical swivel. This part helps keep the X gantry umbilical suspended over the build area. The two parts fit together as shown below, and are secured in place with a M5x40mm bolt and an M5 nut. Tighten so there’s no play in the fit, but the two parts can swivel easily. Set it aside for now.

Put your Lumen up on its haunches and take a look at the left side of the staging plate. Reference the picture below for which holes you should mount the 25mm standoffs. Pass four M3 x 8mm screws through the top side of the staging plate, and tighten them into the standoffs.\n  Now we can mount the motherboard itself. Take the board, and ensuring that the USB ports are facing to the left, and the vacuum sensors on the bottom, thread another four M3 x 8mm screws through the mounting holes on the motherboard into the standoffs.\n  Drivers and Power To begin, install the four stepper motor drivers into the X, Y, Z, and Left Head slots.\n  Next, cut the connector off of the end of the power supply cable. Then separate the two wires, strip off the insulation of each. Twist the stranded copper and insert the wire with the white text into the positive side of the power screw terminal on the motherboard. Insert the black wire into the other terminal, and screw both down tightly.\n      Next, plug in your power brick. Watch for a yellow light by the screw terminal. If you do not see a yellow light, check to make sure you inserted the wires into the correct terminals. Also check to see if the light on the power brick is illuminated.\n    It is very important to not plug in or unplug stepper motor drivers or motors while the board is powered on. Make sure to unplug the power supply before inserting or removing drivers or motors.\n","categories":"","description":"Instructions about how to mount the motherboard on the staging plate","excerpt":"Instructions about how to mount the motherboard on the staging plate","ref":"/docs/motherboard/mounting/","tags":"","title":"Mounting the Motherboard"},{"body":"Now we’ll assemble the two umbilical cables in the machine. The one connecting from the front left leg to the left side of the Y gantry is the Y gantry umbilical, and the one connecting from the front left leg to the X gantry is the X gantry umbilical.\nY Gantry Umbilical This cable bundle will contain the following:\n X axis limit switch cable (XL) X axis motor cable (XM) Two pieces of heatshrink tubing 1150mm (45in) of woven sheathing  Laying out the cables To begin, we’ll get these two cables laid out at the correct spacing. XL and XM should be perfectly aligned on the label side, no offset.\nMeasure out 1150mm of sheathing and cut it from the rest of the spool.\n  Sheathing the cables Now, take the piece of sheathing and expand it by compressing it. You should find that inserting the two cables at the correct offset will maintain this offset while pushing the sheathing over them. Follow the pictures below for a good method of pushing the cables through the sheathing. If it starts to fray a little bit, don’t worry! This is purely a cosmetic step; you can trim off any frayed bits and use the heatshrink to clean up the ends.\n       Push the sheathing up until there’s equal amount of exposed black cable of the shorter cable, as shown below.\n  Heatshrink With the sheathing an equal distance from the closest connector on each side, slide two pieces of heatshrink tubing over the fraying end of the sheathing, with equal amounts on the cables and on the sheathing.

The LumenPnP is an open source Pick and Place project led by Opulo. The LumenPnP is designed to be low cost and suited towards mid-scale manufacturing.\n  The LumenPnP is capable of placing parts as small as 0402, with support for down to 0603. It is currently set up to use strip feeders, but development around active, powered feeders is ongoing.\nIt is completely open source and hackable. The main controller has three AUX ports, allowing anyone to add on peripherals or communicate with other machines.\nWARNING This documentation corresponds with a specific machine Build Number. The Build Number represents what hardware, 3D printed parts, documentation version, and software your machine has. The first number is what version of the Opulo hardware kit you have. The second number dictates which version of the 3D printed parts is used. The third number dictates a version of the docs and software.\n  If you’re building from a kit, check the included pamphlet for Hardware Number. (Early kits have the full build number v2.0.X, if you have this, consider your Hardware Number to be 2.) This is the X value above.\nThe Y value is the Printed Parts Version. When you receive your kit, find the most recent release starting with your Hardware Number, and print the parts found there. Remember this number; these X and Y numbers dictate your machine’s hardware!\nThe Z dictates any software or documentation updates. Use the build number with the highest number in the Z position that you see in the dropdown. This means you’ll be using the most up to date docs and software for your machine’s hardware. Check the drop down in the upper right to select your Build Number.\n  For example, let’s say you received a v2 kit in the mail. The most recent release when you receive your kit is v2.3.4, so you print the parts from that release. Your machine’s hardware is v2.3. If documentation or software updates happen for your hardware, you’ll see other releases like v2.3.5, v2.3.6, or v2.3.7 in the drop down above.

Insert the M5x25mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top of the Belt Tension Arm so that it passes through a GT2 Pulley Idler. Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the Belt Tension Arm and tighten. Make sure the idler can still spin freely.    Insert the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the Front Right Leg (FDM-0002). Insert completed Belt Tension Arm assembly between the arms on the front leg, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up. Insert the M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the Belt Tension Arm and tighten into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut.

Setting this defines our vision pipelines down the road, so it’s important to set these early on and set them well.\n The datum board you used for fisheye calibration can now be mounted to the staging plate! We’re going to be using it for setting the top camera exposure. Using the datum board, four M3x16mm screws, four M3 nuts, and one datum board mount (FDM-0055), mount the datum board on the staging plate as shown in the image below, with the fisheye calibration pattern facing down. You should see a gold grid of lines and a fiducial in the center of the Opulo logo facing upwards. Tighten this down very well; this will define the center point for the entire machine.     Now we’ll home the machine, but we need to change a setting first. Under the Machine Setup tab in OpenPnP, select your machine’s head, then change Homing Method from ResetToFiducialLocation to None. Home your machine using the home icon in OpenPnP. It will move to the limit switches, and get a rough zero position.\n  Now that your datum board is mounted well, it’s time to find out exactly where it is! First, turn on your LED lights using the LED button under Actuators under your camera view. Under the Machine Setup tab in OpenPnP, select your machine’s head, switch the Homing Method back to ResetToFiducialLocation. Then click the icon with the two blue circles and the red brackets around them. This will move the top camera to approximately where your datum board is mounted. Manually jog the head so that the center marking in your top camera view is perfectly centered on the fiducial in the center of the Opulo logo. Your top camera’s focus might be inaccurate from the previous step calibrating out the fisheye. If the fiducial is blurry, twist the lens until it’s as sharp as you can get it.\n  Your view from the top camera might not be bright enough, or it might be overexposed. Either way, we need to set your camera’s exposure. Go back to your Top Camera in the device tree in the Machine Setup tab in OpenPnP, and click on Device Settings.

X Motor Mount Sub-Assembly  Install the GT2 pulley onto the motor shaft. The set screw side of the pulley should be nearest the motor. Tighten the set screws to lock the pulley into place. It should be at the tip of the shaft.    Place the motor onto the X motor mount with the wires exiting the motor on the left side of the bracket.    Insert a M3x8mm machine screw into each of the 4 holes in the bracket and tighten to secure the motor to the mount.    Y Gantry Sub-Assemblies  Insert a M5 Hex Nut into each of the hex nut locations indicated below on a Y Gantry (FDM-0005).     Pull the hex nuts fully into location by screwing a M5x10mm machine screw into them from the opposite side of the Y gantry.

Insert M5 nuts into back side of Y gantry support and then place it onto the two M5x40mm machine screws. Screw them in so they’re attached, but don’t bother tightening them all the way; we’ll need to loosen them in a later step.       Repeat steps 1-9 for the second Y gantry and Y gantry support.  Final Assembly  Place a Y gantry assembly on each end of a v-slot extrusion. Don’t worry about pushing it all the way into the print; there’s extra space for adjustment.    Drop in and position a nut under the machine screw hole on the top of each gantry side and loosely thread a M5x10mm machine screw into each of the nuts.

Plug the cable labeled Y1 into the left Y motor port on the motherboard, and plug the Y2 cable into the right.\n  Next comes the USB cables.

Once this is done, the majority of the machine’s structure is built.\n We’ll start with the back of the X gantry. Insert M5 Hex Nuts into all four of the hex nut locations on the X Gantry Back (FDM-0012).     Pull the hex nuts fully into location by screwing a M5x10mm machine screw into them from the opposite side of the X gantry back. Then unscrew the M5x10mm machine screw.\n  Insert two M3 Hex Nuts vertically into the two slots near each side of the print. Insert two more M3 nuts into the two horizontal slots near the bottom edge of the print.\n    Now, onto the front of the X gantry. Insert M3 Hex Nuts into the six hex nut locations on the X Gantry Front (FDM-0011). Also press two M3 nuts into the vertical slots on the other side of the print.        Pull the hex nuts fully into location by screwing a M3x12mm machine screw into them from the opposite side of the X gantry back. Then unscrew the M3x12mm machine screw.\n  Insert a M5 nylock nut into the recess at the bottom of the X front gantry.\n    Insert a M5x40mm machine screw into each of the top two holes on the X Gantry Front. Onto each of the two machine screws, place a Roller Spacer (FDM-0009), then a V-slot roller.    Place the X gantry rear onto the two machine screws.    Add a M5 nut onto each of the two machine screws. Tighten the nuts on the machine screws so that the two sides are snug against the V-slot rollers.    Place two linear rails onto the front of the X gantry and line up each one with the arrays of three holes on the left and right side. Place three M3x14mm machine screws into each of the rails (the far ends, then one in the middle) and tighten down.    Place the NEMA 17 motor so the shaft runs through the X gantry front and emerges on the same side as the linear rails. Make sure the motor’s connector is pointing towards the umbilical guide as shown in the image. Fasten the NEMA17 motor to the X gantry front using four M3x8mm machine screws.    At the top left of the assembly front, place a limit switch PCB. Fasten the limit switch PCB with two M3x8mm screws.    Place a M5x25mm machine screw through the GT2 idler and into the X gantry front. Secure this machine screw to the gantry by tightening it into M5 nylock nut inserted into the back side. Ensure that the fit is tight and there’s no wiggle in the idler, but also make sure that it can spin freely and isn’t seizing from overtightening.     Now it’s time to mount the Z gantries. Each gantry comes in two parts. The first is a back plate that sits against the linear rail carriage, and connects to the timing belt, called Z Gantry Backplate Left and Right (FDM-0040 and FDM-0041, respectively). These will always be on your machine. Even when you swap toolheads, these will stay attached to the linear rail. On top of these mounts the tool. We’ll be mounting a single Pick Head tool on the left Z gantry.\n  First, we need to get the GT2 timing belt inserted into the back plates at the right spacing. Slide the end of your GT2 belt halfway along the slot in the right z gantry back plate. Then slide the belt into the slot in the left z gantry back plate with 108mm of belt between them (when measuring from the edges of the prints). Your setup should look like the image below:\n    Now we’ll build up the Left Z gantry subassembly. Insert four M3x8mm screws through the Z Gantry Left (FDM-0017), and then through the left z gantry back plate as shown in the images.       Then mount the whole stack onto the left linear rail.       Now we’ll get the Z axis timing belt mounted. Start by placing the GT2 Pulley onto the Z motor shaft. Make sure the Z motor mounting hardware is loose and the motor is slid down in its hardware slots as far down as it can go. Feed the GT2 timing belt attached to the left Z carriage around the pulley. Adjust the pulley on the Z motor shaft so that it’s in line with the z gantry back plates. Attach the right Z gantry to the linear rail just like you did with the left one. Wrap the loose end of your GT2 belt around the idler, and back up to the right Z gantry. Cut it with some excess, and flip the assembly over. Through the port in the back, pull the belt as taught as you can and slot it into the free half of the right z gantry back plate. It’s very likely it’s too long; if this is the case, cut a bit off and try again. We suggest pulling it taught and marking where the other end of the belt is with a marker, and cutting there.    Slide the Z motor up in its hardware slots and check for belt tension. If you’re able to get the belt completely taut, great! If not, remove a loose end of the belt, snip off a belt rib from one side, reinsert, and try again.     After you’re able to achieve proper tension without hitting the end of the Z motor mounting hardware slots, tighten the motor in place under tension. Start with the screw at the top of the print, then the bottom, then the two side screws.\n  Now that our Z gantries are all tightened and moving freely, we can mount our final axis: rotation! Take your NEMA11 hollow shaft stepper motor and place it in the left z gantry. Secure it in place with four M2.5x8mm screws. Make sure the wire port is facing outwards as shown below.\n    Now we’ll mount a few bits of hardware to the hollow shaft motor. Screw the CP40 nozzle holder into the bottom side of the motor, and screw the press-fit pneumatic coupler into the top side.    Fit two of the Belt Clamps (FDM-0027) onto the back of the X gantry, and lightly secure them in place with four M5x10mm screws.

Push the other end onto the inline plastic port of the valve as shown below.\n     Now, cut a 230mm section of the 6mm tubing and push it onto the right-angle plastic port of the valve, and push the other side into the single, larger port of the Y splitter.\n     Now we’ll switch to using the smaller, 4mm tubing. Cut a 235mm length of 4mm OD tubing and push one side into a fork of the Y splitter, and route the other end underneath the motherboard and onto the VAC1 sensor port.\nKeep In Mind This sensor is only attached to the motherboard with six solder joints. Be gentle when pushing the tubing onto it. Twisting the tubing back and forth as you push it down can help get it on without too much force.

Take the loose end, and route it underneath the motherboard, then up through all the zip ties that are holding the X umbilical in place, including those along the swivel arm.\n  Now that the pneumatics are also routed, we can finally tighten the zip ties on the umbilical cable guide. While your machine is still back on its haunches, tighten the zip tie on the umbilical guide to secure the wires and tubing to the frame.\nBring your LumenPnP down onto its four legs, and tighten the zip ties, ensuring to keep a bit of slack between sections. You can move up the umbilical swivel and tighten all the zip ties along the whole thing.\nWith the pneumatic tubing dangling loose past the end of the swivel arm, cut any excess tubing (still allowing some slack for motor rotation) push the other end into the pneumatic coupling on the back side of the rotation stepper motor. Extra slack will allow the motor to rotate freely 180 degrees in each direction, so err on the side of leaving more than less. If the tubing falls away from the umbilical, use one or two small zip ties to secure them together.\n  The bottom of the staging plate should look like the image below:\n  Congratulations, you’re all wired and plumbed up! It’s time to give it a test!\n","categories":"","description":"Making all the pneumatic connections in the machine \n","excerpt":"Making all the pneumatic connections in the machine \n","ref":"/docs/wiring-and-pneumatics/connecting-pneumatics/","tags":"","title":"Connecting the Pneumatics"},{"body":"Halfway through calibration! Just a few more things before we’re running our first job. This step calibrates the relationship between pixels and millimeters to make our cameras more accurate.\n  First, let’s calibrate the top camera. Jog the camera over to your datum board. There are some markers on it that will help us do this exact calibration.\n  Select your top camera in the device tree. Under the General Configuration tab, scroll down to Units Per Pixel. Under the X and Y Object Dimensions, type in the number 5. Then click the Measure button. A box with drag handles will appear in the camera viewfinder. Drag the box so that it perfectly outlines one of the gold boxes on the datum board; they are exactly 5mm x 5mm. Once you have it perfectly outlined, click Confirm. New numbers should populate the Units per Pixel fields, but they should be relatively close to what you found in there to begin with.\n  To confirm, jog around by clicking on various locations on your datum board in the top camera viewfinder and see how accurate the centerpoint of the camera view gets to where you clicked. If it’s inaccurate, try doing the calibration again or tweaking the values in the fields.\n  Now we’ll calibrate the bottom camera. For this, we’ll use a nozzle tip! Put an N24 nozzle on the CP40 Holder, and under your bottom camera’s settings in the device tree, under the Position tab, click the icon with the red nozzle in the blue circle (Hover text says “Position the tool over the center of the location”). This should move your nozzle over the camera. Don’t worry if it’s not exactly centered; we’ll fix this in a later step. It’s important you don’t try to fix this now. Manually jog it over the center of your bottom camera by clicking on the bottom camera viewfinder.\n  Now, do the same calibration that you did for the top camera, but instead of inputting 5 in the X and Y fields, input 4. Drag your bounding box around the nozzle tip so that it’s perfectly tangent to the edges, and press Confirm. Your pixels per millimeter are now calibrated! Try jogging around using the viewfinder and check to see if the reticle is moving where you click.\n  ","categories":"","description":"Setting the millimeters per pixel value in OpenPnP\n","excerpt":"Setting the millimeters per pixel value in OpenPnP\n","ref":"/openpnp/calibration/mm-per-pixel/","tags":"","title":"MM/pixel Calibration"},{"body":"Now that we have both gantries assembled, it’s time to put them together.\n First, fit the X gantry on top of the Y gantry rail. Make sure the X motor is on the left side with the front of the X gantry facing you.  Note You’ll find that it’s hard to fit the X gantry onto the rail. This is because of a few protrusions on the back plate that hold the belt at the right distance. Loosening the M5x40mm bolts holding the two halves of the X gantry together will help it slot onto the rail.    Next, with the top roller bolts still loose, we’ll start adding the second set of rollers on the X gantry that hold it onto the rail. Begin by sliding the X gantry tension bars onto the bottom of the X gantry prints. Slide two rollers in between them, ensuring that the holes in them line up with the holes in the X gantry tension bars.      Now we can secure these in place using a couple M5x40mm bolts. Pass them through the holes, and loosely tighten them into two M5 nuts in the slots on the back side of the X gantry. Don’t tighten all the way yet; we still have some adjustment to do first. You can, however, tighten the top roller bolts now that everything is in its place.       Now we add tension screws. These are what hold the X gantry tension bars in the correct position to have proper tension along the rail. Take four M3x30mm screws and pass them through the holes in the tension bars, and thread into the M3 nuts inserted into the front and back panels of the X gantry, as shown below. Make sure each screw is tightened the same amount, and that the X gantry can still move freely, but doesn’t have any wiggle on the rail. Then tighten the M5x40mm bolts that run through the bottom set of rollers so that their position is locked.       Lastly, we’ll mount the top camera and ring light. First we’ll make the camera subassembly, then mount it to the gantry. Begin by placing the ring light facing downwards into the down light mount. Before we mount the camera into this, we need to loosen the screw holding the lens in place. We’ll need to adjust the focal length after the camera is mounted, so we need to loosen it while we can. Unscrew it just enough such that you can turn the lens in and out. You might need a light grip with pliers to get it to make a full turn; this is ok. After you’ve loosened the lens, place the down camera mount on top, ensuring that the tab from the down light mount fits into the recess. These two prints will pinch the top ring light in place. Lastly, fit the top camera into the down camera mount. Make sure the connector on the back side of the camera is between the two arms of the down camera mount.  Note There’s a piece of black electrical tape on the back of the camera PCB. Don’t remove it; it is there to help isolate the camera sensor from light shining through vias in the PCB.           Secure the whole stack in place with four M2.5x20mm screws. Tighten them down so that all parts are tightly held together, but don’t overtorque; these screws are threading into the plastic of a print.    Mount the top camera and light subassembly onto the back of the X gantry using two M3x14mm screws.

Make sure the X motor is on the left of the machine when you do this.  Heads Up You might find that it’s hard to fit the Y gantry onto the frame. This is because of a few protrusions on the Y gantry that hold the belt at the right distance. Loosening the M5x40mm bolts holding the two halves of the Y gantries together, and loosening the bolts that hold the Y gantries onto the X axis extrusion will help it slot onto the rail. Be sure to retighten them after fitting the gantry on the frame.    On both sides, below the rail, insert a v-slot roller with a roller spacer on each side. Then push a M5x40mm machine screw through the gantry and roller assembly, securing it with an M5 nut in the slot on the Y gantry support.     Now roll the Y gantry to the very front of the machine. Adjust the fit of the X axis extrusion inside the Y gantries so that the top rollers fit perfectly into the v-slot. After you budge them in or out to make the top rollers sit perfect, tighten the top bolts you only loosely threaded a few steps ago. This is locking in the X axis extrusion spacing.\n  Now we need to make sure this spacing doesn’t just work for the front of the machine, but for the entire length of it as well. Loosen the machine screws connecting the back rail to the left and right side. While applying light pressure down on the Y gantry, roll it to the back of the machine. You might find that you need to expand or contract the back legs to have the rollers ride perfectly in the v-slot. Once you have the correct spacing, tighten the bolts mounting the back rail. This locks in the Y gantry extrusion spacing for the back of the machine as well. We also recommend measuring the spacing between the rails in the front and back of the machine, and adjusting until they’re the same.\n  Place the staging plate onto the frame.\n    Drop in four nuts and secure the staging plate to the frame using four M5x8mm screws.    When tightening the staging plate down, ensure that it is exactly 95mm away from the front leg print on both sides. This will be important for using the OpenPnP configuration provided for the machine. Reference the image below to see where to measure.    Wahoo! You’re all parallel! Now we can tighten the rollers on the Y gantry. Adjust the bottom rollers up so they snug against the extrusion and ensure that the v-slot rollers run well in the slots. This adjustment should be done with the M3x16mm screws in the bottom of the Y Gantry Body and Y Gantry Support. You want to make sure that there’s no play or wiggle in the fit, but don’t overtighten to the point of increasing resistance to rolling. The gantry should move easily, but not loosely.

OpenPnP has a built in “wizard” to help set this offset, so we’ll use that to help us do it.\n  Select your nozzle in the device tree, and click on the Offset Wizard menu option.\n  Leave the Include Z? box unchecked. Now you have a couple choices. You can follow OpenPnP’s instructions using putty or flour, or you can use your homing fiducial. We recommend trying our version, and following OpenPnP’s instructions as a backup.\n  Using an N045 nozzle tip, jog the nozzle so that it is just barely touching the datum board, and perfectly centered over the homing fiducial. We recommend looking for the shiny edge of the gold fiducial poking out from under the nozzle tip to determine if you’ve centered it correctly. Now, click the Store nozzle mark position button.\n  It’s important that you don’t navigate away from the nozzle menu in the device tree during this; it’ll wipe your stored nozzle mark position. Now, jog the nozzle up, and jog the top camera to the homing fiducial. Center it exactly on the fiducial, and click the Calculate nozzle offset button. You’ve now stored the nozzle offset!\n  ","categories":"","description":"Calibrating the offset of the nozzle from the top camera\n","excerpt":"Calibrating the offset of the nozzle from the top camera\n","ref":"/openpnp/calibration/nozzle-offset/","tags":"","title":"Nozzle Offset Calibration"},{"body":"With a complete frame assembled, we can now route the GT2 timing belt that makes everything move!\n We’ll start with the Y axis. If you’d like to precut your belt instead of routing the entirety of it through the machine, you can cut two 1400mm lengths for the Y axis motors. To help guide the belth through the openings in the prints, bend it backwards as shown below so that the belt has a curve to it.       Take your length of GT2 belt and stick it inside the extrusion (smooth side facing outward), behind the Y gantry as shown below. Take an allen wrench or similar tool and guide the belt through the opening on the side closest to the front of the machine. Once you have it pulled through, loosen the bolts holding the belt clamp onto the Y gantry, and slide it underneath the belt clamp you mounted in an earlier step. Tighten it down with the GT2 belt flush with the edge of the Y gantry.         Now, take the other end of your belt and feed it through the front leg. Guide it through and around the idler wheel in the tensioning arm, and feed it back through the other side of the leg as shown below.       Feed the other end of your belt behind the Y gantry support print, and all the way through the back leg. Loop it around the GT2 pulley on the stepper motor, and feed it through the other side of the leg.     Finally, take the end of the belt and feed it through the other opening of the Y gantry, like we did in step 1. Feed the end between the Y gantry and the belt clamp. Make sure the belt tensioner on the front leg is completely unscrewed, meaning it’s angled as close to the leg as it can be. This will give us the most possible stroke to tension the belt in the next step.\n  Pull on the belt with one hand, while holding the Y gantry steady with the other. Getting it generally taught is preferable, but don’t worry about getting it perfect; we’ll tension it correctly next. Push down on the belt clamp to hold the belt in place, and tighten the two bolts to clamp it down. Cut the belt with at least 20mm remaining out the back side of the Y gantry.\n  Now we can tension the belt. Slowly tighten in the M3 screw on the belt tensioner to increase the belt tension. Pulling back on the belt tensioner arm should be difficult, but possible. A tug should result in only a 2mm deflection.\n  Perform the same steps on the other side of the machine.\n  We’re going to do the exact same operation for the X axis, but with one small thing to keep in mind. When looking at the back of the machine, start by clamping the belt on the right side of the X gantry (the side closest to the motor). This way, the excess belt will be sticking out of the X gantry on the side opposite of the limit switch, and prevent a problem with homing. You can precut a 1500mm strip of belt for the X axis.\n  ","categories":"","description":"Attaching and tensioning belts for the X and Y gantries\n","excerpt":"Attaching and tensioning belts for the X and Y gantries\n","ref":"/docs/mechanical-assembly/attaching-belts/","tags":"","title":"Attaching Belts"},{"body":"Now that we know the offset from the top camera to the nozzle, we can use the nozzle to set our bottom camera position.\n  Select the bottom camera in the device tree. Click on the Position menu tab.\n  Click on the icon with the red nozzle in blue circle to jog the nozzle to the bottom camera position. This should get it pretty close, but it likely won’t be exact. It’s also possible that the tip of the nozzle is not in focus from the fisheye calibration step; adjust the bottom camera focus by turning the lens until the nozzle tip is sharp and in focus. Make sure that the Z height is at 61mm when you do this. That’s the height that we lift the nozzle to for vision operations so that we can get larger components into the field of view. 61mm is not hard-coded anywhere; you can make it closer if you don’t need bottom vision on larger parts that require a bigger field of view. Just make sure your focal range matches the Z height of your bottom camera position, and you’re all set.\n  Jog the nozzle to be perfectly centered over the bottom camera, and click on the blue nozzle icon to capture the position (see image below).

You can always have OpenPnP prompt you to do this manually, but there’s a feature for automatic nozzle swapping that can just do it for you! In this optional step, we’ll set it up. Perform the following steps for each of the nozzle tips you’d like to enable it for. We recommend reading the OpenPnP Wiki page about this as well. Before starting, put the labeled nozzle tips into the holder in their respective labeled slots. Also make sure to lubricate the end of your nozzle holder with the lubrication packet included with your nozzles.\n  Select the nozzle tip you’re setting up under the Nozzle Tips menu in the device tree. Select the Tool Changer tab.\n  Now we can start capturing positions. The way automatic nozzle changing works is by replaying four position commands either forward or backward, to either load or unload a nozzle tip, respectively. We’re going to start with the last position, because it’s easiest for getting our Z height correct.\n  Jog your nozzle with the relevant nozzle tip loaded to just in front of your nozzle rack, in front of the slot for that nozzle tip. Adjust the Z height until it’s clear it’ll slide into the rack. Also ensure that it’s aligned in the Y axis so that only a X movement would be necessary to slot it into place. Capture the nozzle position for the Last Location.\n  Now we’re going to slowly jog the nozzle tip into the nozzle rack. Make sure you’re only jogging in the X axis for a clean action. Jog by increments of 0.1mm until you see the nozzle tip pop completely into place. Try to ensure there’s no lateral strain on the nozzle holder. If there is, we’ll see this in a later step and can correct it then. Capture the Third Location nozzle position.\n  The next position is for making sure that the nozzle tip is completely seated on the CP40 holder during insertion. Jog the Z axis down two millimeters. This is not a hard and fast value, if you find that a larger or smaller value gets the nozzle tip seated completely, feel free to use that value instead. The spring in the CP40 holder will take up these few millimeters. Capture the Second Location nozzle position.\n  Now jog the Z axis up 30 millimeters. This is the clearance position where the nozzle holder is getting ready for the plunge. Capture the First Location nozzle position.\n  You can now play through the positions by clicking on the “move nozzle to position” buttons in order. Tune any values in the fields as necessary to ensure you get a clean and straight insertion.\n  Now that your positions are set, you can enable automatic tool changing in OpenPnP. You can find this checkbox as shown in the image below.\n    If you’d like to clone these positions for every nozzle tip in the rack, you can use the “Cloning Settings” section in the OpenPnP docs to help you.

Now we’ll mount some components to the bottom of the staging plate.\nOverview Refer to the image below for referencing where to mount parts on the staging plate.\n  Pump mount The first thing we’ll mount to the staging plate is the Pump Mount (FDM-0025). This print suspends the pump using a couple rubber bands to ensure none of the vibration of the pump is transferred into the frame.\n  Start by press-fitting M3 nuts into the recesses in the pump mount.\n  Now we’ll mount the pump in the print using a couple rubber bands. Start by grabbing the rubber band with both hands, giving it a half twist, and folding it over on itself, making two loops.\n         Now stretch each rubber band over each pair of pegs on the mount. Guide the pump between each pair of bands so that it’s suspended in the print.         Mount it to the staging plate using two M3 x 10mm screws in the location shown below.    Valve mount Now we’ll attach the Valve Mount (FDM-0042) to the staging plate.\n  Press fit M3 nuts into the recesses in the valve mount.\n  Now we’ll mount the valve to the print. Use two M3x8mm bolts to attach the valve to the mount as shown below. Mount it to the staging plate using four M3x8mm screws in the location shown below.\n    Pneumatic Y splitter mount  This one is easy! We’ll just mount the pneumatic Y splitter to the staging plate using an M3x30mm bolt and an M3 nut. You can find the correct location and orientation to mount it below:    Bottom camera mount   Stack the Up Light Mount (FDM-0019), the Bottom Ring Light, and the Up Camera Mount (FDM-0020) together.\n  Attach them to the staging plate using four M3x30mm screws and four M3 nuts.\n  Loosen the screw on the camera so that we can adjust the camera’s focus later. Even after doing so, it still might be difficult to rotate the lens. A light grip with some pliers and a gentle twist can help break the lens free and make it easier to rotate by hand. Mount the camera into the up camera mount using four M2.5x8mm screws by tapping directly into the plastic. Match the orientation to the image below:\n    Nozzle Holder   Grab the Nozzle Holder (FDM-0024) and slide three M3 nuts into the slots in the back of the print.\n  Using three M3x8mm machine screws, tighten it onto the staging plate as shown below.\n       ","categories":"","description":"Mounting components to the staging plate \n","excerpt":"Mounting components to the staging plate \n","ref":"/docs/mechanical-assembly/populating-staging-plate/","tags":"","title":"Populating the Staging Plate"},{"body":"Now that you’ve got your Index built up, it’s time to test it!\nWhat you’ll need:  Computer CNCjs Your completed Index USB-C cable  ","categories":"","description":"How to test your Index after building","excerpt":"How to test your Index after building","ref":"/docs/testing/","tags":"","title":"Testing"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/","tags":"","title":""},{"body":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/featured-background_hu1d2bd6459b468407bedba057a8d6aa60_2903339_960x540_fill_q75_catmullrom_top.jpg); } @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) { #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/featured-background_hu1d2bd6459b468407bedba057a8d6aa60_2903339_1920x1080_fill_q75_catmullrom_top.jpg); } }  LumenPnP Documentation Docs   YouTube   An open source pick and place for mid-scale manufacturing\n\n          Follow us on YouTube!
